# Hello EveryOne HERE we will be doing the Pandas

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# We are Starting By reading the CSV Files and for that I m including a csv file in repo

# df  = pd.read_csv('pandas.csv')
# print(df)


# What is basically a dataframe - ?

# A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).


# Now to write the data in the CSV -

# nme = ["aparna", "pankaj", "sudhir", "Geeku"]
# deg = ["MBA", "BCA", "M.Tech", "MBA"]
# scr = [90, 40, 80, 98]

# dict = {"Name":nme , "Degree":deg, "Score":scr}
# df.to_csv("file.csv")




# It will automatically create A csv to your folder




# Now Accessing the dataframe parts

data = {'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Eve',
'Charlie'], 
'Age': [25, 30, 22, 35, 28], 
'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male'], 
'Salary': [50000, 55000, 40000, 70000, 48000]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# print(df)

# to access the age column


# age_column = df["Age"]
# print(age_column)

# if want to access multiple columns at a time 

# print(df[['Name', 'Age']])

# Now accessing the rows of the df

print(df.iloc[0])
print(df.loc[0])

# here whats the difference between the loc and the iloc - 
# iloc -  It uses the integer location where 0 is the first row
# loc - It uses the label location 
# where 0 is the row with index 0


# to understand better of the iloc and the loc 

# a   Alice     85
# b     Bob     92
# c Charlie     78

# suppose this is the dataframe 

# df.iloc[0] means the first row that is alice row 
# even though the label is a , but iloc[0] means first row no matter what the label is 

# df.loc['a'] - means that get the row with the label 'a' however output of above and this will be same 



# Accessing the Cell means row and column through the loc and the iloc 

# print(df.iloc[1,0])
# means second row and the first column that is 'Bob'

print(df.loc['b','Name'])
# Row label 'b', column 'Name' ‚ûù 'Bob'
